Abundance graphs
  Species
  Classes

Relative composition stacked bar graphs
  Species
  Classes

Size structure (Biovolume) => NBSS (normalised biomass size structure) as per paper: ___?
  Biovolume/m^3 (um^3/m^3)
  
Biomass graphs
  Biomass between sites overall
  Biomass % composition stacked bars
  Biomass large (5+mm) vs med (2-5mm) vs small (0-2mm) between groups

Diversity stuff
  Rank Abundance + quantitative comparisons for each site
  Shannon Div Index for each site
  Species eveness for each site
